### About me

I'm a 27 years-old software developer and I have been working with Android development since 2016, and with iOS development since 2018. I have a vast experience in native applications, being a part of multiple apps across my career, from project creation to store deploy.

### My technical skillset

- Kotlin and Swift is my bread and butter, but I have experience working with Java, C and PHP as well
- I'm used to work with MVVM and Clean architecture, but I have previously worked with MVC, MVP, MVI, VIPER, VIP and so on
- I'm well familiar with versioning systems, and I've used many platforms, like GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket and Azure
- I like to pay attention to code quality and best practices when I'm coding, so I'm familiar with SOLID, Clean Code, code analysis tools (Detekt, Sonar) and linters (Swiftlint, Ktlint)
- I can handle remote and local data within my apps, and have experience with Rest APIs, Retrofit, Alamofire, GraphQL, RoomDB, SQLite, SharedPreferences, UserDefaults and DataStore
- I have worked with several agile environments, such as Scrum, Kanban and a few custom agile methodologies based on what works best for each company
- Automation, CI and pipelines are common in my daily routine, and I have experience working with Azure DevOps, Jenkins and Gitlab CI, as well as setting up automation processes and pipeline steps
- Testing is a must (and a personal favorite), so I'm well experienced with unit testing, junit, mockito, mockK and testing theory in general - seriously, I've done a few testing workshops and I'd like to do some more
- I'm eager to learning, so I'm always trying to keep up with the recent techs from Android and iOS environments. I'm looking forward to learn and work with Compose, SwiftUI and Combine

### What makes me different from everyone else

- My communication skills: I am VERY communicative, and I believe it's crucial to maintain communication and collaboration between teammates, as well as different teams and squads and chapter members
- My problem solving skills: I am an outstanding problem solver (not my words), which means I take issues and bugs seriously and I will investigate and debug it like no one else
- My collaborative skills: I am a teamworker, and I believe no one does it on their own. I enjoy working with multiple people with the most diverse backgrounds and points of view, and I feel fulfilled when I have the opportunity to help a fellow developer to grow, so I really like code reviews and pair programming sessions
- My leadership skills: I am a natural leader, which means it will be common for me to take action in order to solve issues and help out my team

### Besides all that

- I am a Christian, and it's a big part of my identity and personality!
- I am passionate about music, very ecletic, and I like music from the 60s the same way I like music from 2024. I also play guitar, electric guitar and piano
- I am a very active person and I enjoy practicing multiple sports, but currently I'm focused on soccer, running, cycling and working out
- I am married since 2019, and I have a dog and a cat - they love each other (most of the time)
